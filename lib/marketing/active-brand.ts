 * DEFAULT_THEME_KEY.
 *
 * For SSR we always return DEFAULT_THEME_KEY — the correct theme is
 * applied client-side by:
 *   1. An inline <script> in <head> (FOUC prevention, runs before paint).
 *   2. <ThemeProvider> inside <AuthProvider> (syncs React state once loaded).
 *
 * Client.themeKey in the DB is intentionally ignored for UI rendering.
 * It remains in the schema for future use (e.g. email templates, exports).
